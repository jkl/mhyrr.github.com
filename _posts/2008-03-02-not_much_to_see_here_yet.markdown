Finally, I have a proper blog again.  It's been a long time coming, since I've wanted to do a bunch of things in the process: learn Wordpress a bit better, setup Feedburner, Tumblr, Twittr, switch hosting, etc.  Oh, and of course there's always the whole real life gig that tends to take up so much time.  In the meantime, I've also bought a new car (finally, no more $3.80/gallon diesel), done some furniture shopping, and done a lot of planning for 2008.  It's proving to be an exciting year.

As I actually get this ramped up with, you know, real content (*gasp*), I'll be adding some backfill from Tumblr and a couple of other sources, since I was using them as a temporary platform until this was ready to go.
