title: The Album Art Meme

Here's a fun way to come up with a piece of album art that, despite first impressions,  works surprisingly well.  It comes from [The Fishbowl](http://fishbowl.pastiche.org/2008/01/12/album_art_meme), and here's how it works:

"How to create your album cover:

Your band name is the title of your first hit on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">Wikipedia's random page</a>
Your album name is taken from the end of the last quote on <a href="http://www.quotationspage.com/random.php3">this random quotes page</a>
Your album cover must be made from the fourth picture on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/explore/interesting/7days/">Flickr's interesting photos page</a>"

It's a hash of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRNG">PRNG'</a>s in a way, so each ought to be pretty original.  But how frequently can the hash actually make sense?  I've seen a few people do it, and each time the resulting album cover is at least plausible, if not downright beautiful [This one](http://plasmasturm.org/log/490/) is my favorite I've seen.

Anyway, here's my attempt, following all the rules.  Akal Ustat, from what I can tell, is the name of a piece of holy text describing the eternal and infinite qualities of God.  The complete quote, from Blaise Pascal, is "Since we cannot know all that there is to be known about anything, we ought to know a little about everything."  I'm fascinated that it worked out that well.
